# Ethereum-petshop
A proof of concept of the Ethereum pet shop

## Instructions to get started:
- Download, install and run [ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/)
- clone repository and install npm dependencies
- run ``npm run dev``

Normally smart contracts once executed stay on the Mainnet of ethereum blockchain forever and since ganache is a local specific instance for testing purposes, pups bought on my local instance might not reflect on yours and so on.

Cheers
